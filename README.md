# C PROGRAMMING NOTES


## IDE: 
Helps us in writing codes by correcting our methods  etc... for eg VSCode
## Compiler:
Helps to run the code and convert it into machine language for our CPU to understand it... for eg mingw

## THINGS IN C CODE:
-pre prcessor commands - #include<stdio.h>... studio.h file ki necessity hai is program me so vo vali file include kro
funtions - int main()... program ko break krne ke liye use hota hai taki alg alg cheeze perform kr pae (int main alg hota hai coz vaha se program ka execution shuru hota... 'main' isme function ka name hai and 'int' ye function return krta hai, ye dusre functions ko call krta hai taki dusre functions return me answer krte hai 
variables
statements
expressions
comments

## Steps that happen while running a command:
Pre processing
Compilation
Assembly
Linking
Loading 

## What is variable:
A name given to a memory location
Declared by writing type variable_name
Initialized and declared by type variable_name = value;

## RULES FOR VARIABLES:
Can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore
A variable  name can start with an alphabet and undercore only
Can't start with a digit
No whitespace & reserved  keywords is allowed
Valid varibles names: int anshul, float anshul123, char _anshul34
Invalid variable name: $anshul, int 77anshull , char long;
 
## Data types in c:
Basic data type: int, char, float, double
Dervied data type: array, pointer, structure, union
Enumeration data type: emun
Void data type: void

## OPERATOR:
An operator is a symbol used  to perform operations in given programming language

## Types Of If Else Statement (CONTROL STATEMENT):
If statement
If Else statement
If - Else If ladder
Nested If

## Rules for Switch Statement:
Switch expression must be 'int' or 'char'
Case value must be an integer or a char
Case must come inside switch
Break is not a must

## Types of Loops:
Do While Loop
While loop
For Loop

## Properties of Expressions in for loop:
1 we can initialize more than 1 variable at a time
Putting expression in code is option and not a must task
